# Memory-Game

Front-end Memory Game application built using React. The application incorporates both stateful and stateless components while adding some dynamic styling.

## How to Play

The user starts the game by clicking on a character. The user then continues to click on characters until either 1) A character is clicked which has already been guessed or 2) No further non-guessed characters exist. At this point, the round ends and a new round begins.

The score is tallied for each round, along with a tally for the Top Score of the game. 

A new game can be initiated by clicking the "Memory Game" banner or refreshing the page.

Please refer to the video below for details regarding how the app works.
